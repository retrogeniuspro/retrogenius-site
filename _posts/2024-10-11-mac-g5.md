## Common Information

The iMac G5/2.1 20" (iSight) is an all-in-one desktop computer designed by Apple. It was released in October 2005 and it was one of the last machines to use PowerPC processor technology. The 2005 20" iSight model featured a dual-core 2.1 GHz PowerPC 970fx (G5) processor, which provided a significant boost in performance compared to its predecessors.

The iMac G5's design is also noteworthy. It retains the sleek, curved shape that characterized earlier iMacs, but with some minor modifications to accommodate the new PowerPC G5 processor. The aluminum casing and flat-panel display made it a visually stunning machine.

The new model featured a sleeker, more compact build, and for the first time, an integrated iSight webcam was mounted above the LCD screen. This allowed users to easily capture photos and video using the built-in camera.

The remote control that was available with this iMac made it easy to use Apple's Front Row media interface, allowing users to access music, videos, and other digital content without having to physically interact with their computer. Other upgrades included even faster processors, more RAM, larger hard drives, and improved graphics capabilities.

SuperDrives became standard across all iMac models, making it easier than ever for users to rip CDs and copy DVDs onto their computers. The Apple Mighty Mouse was also included, providing a convenient way to interact with the computer's interface.

However, it's worth noting that this revised design came with some compromises. The stand was no longer replaceable with a VESA mount, and modems were removed from the computer's specifications. Additionally, the internal components became more difficult to access, making customization less straightforward than before.

The iMac G5 played a crucial role in Apple's transition to Intel processors, paving the way for future generations of iMacs and other Mac computers. This model also demonstrated Apple's commitment to innovation and design excellence, which would become hallmarks of their products.

The iMac G5 is special because it marked the last iMac to use a PowerPC processor, featured an updated design with a flat-panel display, and introduced several notable features that would become standard in future Mac computers.
